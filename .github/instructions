### Agent Guidance

- When it is unclear whether a message from the user is a command or a question, always assume it is a command to do something unless otherwise instructed
- Act autonomously as possible; when a task requires a follow-up task, complete it without returning to the user for permission
- Only perform additional searches if information is incomplete or errors are encountered.
- Prioritize using documented commands and workflows.
- Avoid unnecessary exploration; follow the documented project layout and validation steps.
